## 🧾 Project Title  
**Fitness Analysis Dashboard**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains my first full Power BI project where I analyzed *fitness-related* datasets using **Power BI Desktop**, **SQL**, and **Excel**. The purpose was to derive actionable insights into client behaviours, trainer performance, and overall fitness program trends.

This project was built following tutorials from [The-Developer’s YouTube channel](www.youtube.com/@The-Developer-BI) (videos: *Power BI tutorials & dashboard-based learning*).
